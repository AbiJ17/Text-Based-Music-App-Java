# Text-Based-Music-App-Java
A Java application similar to Apple Music, that creates a digital music service for organizing, preserving, and streaming audio materials such as songs, audiobooks, and podcasts. 
This application leverages object-oriented programming principles, utilizing arrays, arrayLists, exceptions, polymorphism, collections (such as maps), inheritance, and interfaces to organize and handle various types of audio content, including Songs and AudioBooks. It provides users with the capability to view and store content, download songs and audiobooks, craft new playlists, and modify existing ones by adding or removing content.

There are 2 versions of this application: 
- 1st Version (Normal version)
- 2nd Version (Same as 1st version, but with a few developmental changes, such as the inclusion of collections (maps) and exceptions)

Both versions work and provides the expected output. Dive in and start crafting your personalized playlists!
